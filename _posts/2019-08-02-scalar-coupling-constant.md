## What is a Scalar Coupling Constant?

NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy is one of the most popular tools to elucidate chemical structures of an unknown molecule in solution. In practical application, NMR can also be used to validate new structures because it provides information about scalar coupling, which is an indirect interaction of the nuclei of atoms in a magnetic field.
These scalar coupling, or J coupling constants obtained from an NMR spectrum contain information about relative bond distances and angles in a molecule. This is useful for determining the connectivity of atoms in a molecule.
For the seasoned chemist, confirming a basic chemical structure from the peaks on an NMR spectra alone is definitely possible, such as the 1H NMR spectrum for 1,1,2-trichloroethane below. The peaks below correspond to the hydrogens in the molecule and can easily be assigned.
