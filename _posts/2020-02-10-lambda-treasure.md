The [Lambda Treasure project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1paReyy2r0PrJuhF355_TdHyx5CPw3yfj) is a combonation of the the things we learned in
the Computer Science portion of [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com)

This project includes the use of:

- Blockchain Technology
- Graphs
- Computer Architecture
- API endpoints
- Advanced Algorithms

### What is the project about

During the week we were given to work on this, we were supposed to catch as many
Golden Snitches as possible.

In order to catch a Golden Snitch, you have to be able to get to the Dark World.

To go to the Dark World, you need boots, a jacket, and the ability to warp.

To get boots and a jacket, you need to mine Lambda Coin.

To get Lambda Coin you need to buy a name.

To buy a name you need to have 1000 gold.

To get 1000 gold you need to traverse the map and find treasure.

So, we'll go ahead and start there.
