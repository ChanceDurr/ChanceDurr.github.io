# Wild Fire Watch

Note: This may need updated as the project moves forward

## What I did as the Data Scientist

### Week 1

Week 1 conisisted of planning our release canvases and what we wanted to do moving forward on this project. We were picking this project up after another group of students had worked on it,  as it was a build-on project. A lot of the planning had revolved around what had been done, what should be improved, and what should be added.

### Week 2

Week 2 was an interesting week, as it had been the first time I actually worked on/with someone else's code. It was a completely different change of pace for me. Trying to understand where they had everything was _different_ and challenging.
The main scope of this week was to get the RESTful API back up and running for our front-end devs. 

### Week 3

Week 3 we created some api endpoints for the front-end using RSS feed from inciweb to grab wildfire data from as the previous api from before weren't quite working the way they should have been. This was a nice step to be able to see the front-end get a little more filled in as far as the mapbox goes.

### 10/18/2019

Currently waiting to for week 3 of 8 to finish up
