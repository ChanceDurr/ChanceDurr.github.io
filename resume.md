My name is **Chance Dare**. I am 21 years old. I am going to school for Data Science, Machine Learning and AI at Lambda School. My background as far as programming goes is just self taught. I have taken plenty of courses at [_Codecademy_](https://www.codecademy.com) and know the basics of a few different languages.

Before going to school, I was an electrical apprentice. The path I was on would have gotten me to about ~$100,000/year in 5 years after I had completed the apprenticeship. However, after about a year, I decided the work I was doing was not something I would want to do for the rest of my life.
