## Summary

Data Scientist with 1+ years of experience executing data-driven solutions to increase efficiency, accuracy, and utility of internal data processing. Experienced at creating data regression models, using predictive data modeling, and analyzing data mining algorithms to deliver insights and implement action-oriented solutions to complex business problems.

## Experience

### Wildfire Watch, Auburn, WA — Data Scientist

Used satellite image data to produce machine learning models that recognize wildfires. Deploy a Flask application with RESTful API endpoints to send wildfire location data to front-end. Instantiate and fill a postgreSQL database with daily satellite image data to create historical data to train/test with.

  -- 9 month full-time course for Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.


- ### Soldotna High School, Soldotna, AK — Diploma - May 2016

## Projects

### Scalar Coupling Constant Kaggle Competition

Used a combination of 8 different machine learning models to get a low score(Logarithmic Mean Absolute Error). Cleaned molecular data and engineered new features to be used with ML models. Worked with a chemistry student to help explain the meaning and importance of different features to help give a better understanding and background knowledge of the data.
