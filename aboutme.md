One of my favorite hobbies is electronics and IoT things!

I've had a Raspberry Pi and a lot of Arduino stuff for a while and love creating
things. The most recent thing I made was for my brother. It's an LED that
automatically turns on when he starts streaming on Twitch. That way our family
knows not to go into his room. Kind of like a Recording light for studios!

## Growing Up

I was lucky to have a laptop growing up which really introduced me into the
fun stuff that you can do with electronics. I remember trying to learn my first
programming language not long after getting my first laptop. If I remember
correctly the first language I started learning was Lua. I was able to get the
basics down pretty quick and build a calculator with it.

From there I was always taking stuff apart, including that computer. Eventually
I became the go to for all electronic stuff for my family.

## Intro to Python and Robotics

After graduating high school I went to trade school for Industrial Electricty.
When I attended there we had a unit on robotics and programming and that's
where I got introduced to Python!

Since I already had a little bit of programming experience growing up, I blew
through the unit super quickly and ended up building and programming a drone
for the instructor.

Now with all of my knowledge of electricity and programming, my hobby is
extremely intresting and keeps me occupied in my free time.
